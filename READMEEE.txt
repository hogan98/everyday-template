This is A basic Template to set up a new style of containers for spacing etc.

I have Also created variables in root: css and in the _variables.scss file

Below is instructions on how to use the new grid instead of container , the setup is done in scss but can be done in css too.

Add the class content-grid for standard centered content,
              breakout to break out from the grid,
              full-width for full width sizing.
